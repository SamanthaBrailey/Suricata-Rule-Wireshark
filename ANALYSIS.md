# Full Analysis — Suricata + Wireshark Project


## Summary
We simulated an attacker probing for a hidden admin page (`/secret_admin_area`) by sending HTTP requests to a local Python server. Wireshark captured the packets, and a custom Suricata rule detected the request and generated an alert in `fast.log`.


---


## Evidence Collected
1. **Wireshark PCAP** — shows `HEAD /secret_admin_area` HTTP request.
2. **Suricata fast.log** — contains alert `[HTTP request to /secret_admin_area]`.
3. **Screenshots** — proof of server, traffic, Suricata run, and logged alerts.

## Why This Matters
- Attackers often scan for hidden endpoints like `/admin`, `/login`, or `/secret_area` to find weak points.  
- Detecting these probes early is critical for **intrusion detection** and **SOC operations**.  
- Writing IDS rules builds the foundation for **network security monitoring** and **blue team analysis**.


---


## Possible False Positives
- Automated scanners or vulnerability tools during penetration tests.  
- Legitimate internal health checks hitting unknown URIs.


---


## Next Steps / Remediation
- Restrict access to admin areas with authentication and IP allowlists.  
- Deploy WAF rules to block requests to sensitive URIs.  
- Correlate alerts with logs (Apache/Nginx) for additional context.  


---


## SOC Playbook (When This Alert Fires)
1. Collect the PCAP for the session.  
2. Check the source IP reputation (internal vs external).  
3. Review web server logs for repeated scanning patterns.  
4. Block or isolate suspicious IP if malicious.  
5. Escalate if persistent or tied to known attacker infrastructure.

## Real-World Use Cases
- Portfolio: shows ability to **write, test, and validate Suricata rules**.  
- SOC/IR: practice exercise for alert triage, log correlation, and packet validation.  
- Threat hunting: extend rules to catch other suspicious URIs, methods, or user-agents.
